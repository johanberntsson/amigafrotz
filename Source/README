FROTZ V2.41 - An interpreter for all Infocom games and other Z-machine  games.
Complies with standard 1.0 of Graham Nelson's specification.

Originally written by Stefan Jokisch in 1995-1997.
Reference code currently maintained by Jim Dunleavy.
Ported to Unix by Galen Hazelwood.
Unix port currently maintained by David Griffith.

- Compiles and runs on most common flavors of Unix, both open source and not.
- Plays all Z-code games including V6.
- Old-style sound support through OSS driver.
- Config files.
- Stricter error checking.
- Default use of the Quetzal file format.  Command line option to use the
  old format.  There are several differences between the old-style save 
  format at Quetzal such that converting from old-style and Quetzal is 
  difficult if not impossible.  This also means you can't restore an 
  old-style save and then save your game in Quetzal.
- Now distributed under the GNU Public License.

============
Packaging || 
============
Please email me if you wish to put Unix Frotz into something
like a .deb, .rpm, Slackware package, the NetBSD pkgsrc tree, FreeBSD's
ports tree, or anything like that so I can note that on the Unix Frotz
webpage at http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi.  _PLEASE_ don't try to do
anything like have auto-install scripts grab files from that page.  Use
ftp.gmd.de or one of its mirrors for that.


====================
Maintainer switch ||
====================
A few months after I submitted my superpatch against Galen Hazelwood's
Unix port of Frotz 2.32, I started playing around again with Unix Frotz to
start adding new features.  I emailed Galen asking if he would be putting
out a new release of Unix Frotz any time soon because I had some nifty new
features to add.  He replied with "no" and asked if I was volunteering to
take over the port.


====================
The switch to GPL ||
====================
Beginning with version 2.40, Frotz is now licensed under the GNU Public
License.  This change came about from an email conversation with Stefan
Jokisch in late May 2000.  I asked if he was still developing the core
code and asked if he'd consider changing the license to GPL or
BSD-like.  He replied by introducing me to Jim Dunleavy to whom he handed
off development of the Frotz core code.  At that time, he decided to
change the license to GPL starting with the one Jim was working on.  Jim
and I then swapped patches back and forth to do some more work on the core
code and so now we have Frotz 2.40.
