Summary of changes between Unix Frotz 2.40 and Unix Frotz 2.41:
===============================================================

Unix Frotz 2.41 was released on Monday May 21, 2001.

NEW FEATURES

- Now includes several test zcode programs in the bugtest/ subdirectory.  
  These are crashme, TerpEtude, gntests, and strictz.

- Unix Frotz confirmed to compile and run on Mac OS X.  See INSTALL for 
  details.  
  (Confirmation by Steven Frank)

- Status line padding in screen.c changed to allow for screens narrower 
  than 80 columns.
  (Patch by Steven Frank)


BUG FIXES AND MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- In BUGS, an idiosyncracy of "Journey" by Infocom was mistakenly 
  identified as a bug in Frotz.
  (Reported by someone whom I forget)

- In text.c, static zchar zscii_to_latin1[] was being improperly 
  initialized.  The bug caused Latin1-style quotes <<like this>> to look 
  >>like this<<.
  (Reported and fixed by Matteo De Luigi)

- In the 2.40 release, I disabled the -i option thinking it wasn't needed.  
  This was probably a mistake.  Even if the -Z option is set to '0' (don't 
  report errors), fatal errors will still be reported.  Some careless 
  programmers have released buggy games which include fatal errors.   
  Proper interpreters should abort upon encountering them, but some don't.  
  The -i option is intended as a kludge to deal with such games and for 
  debugging by ignoring the requirement to abort.  This option should not 
  be used as an excuse to write bad code.  Code in object_address() in  
  object.c was modified to complain about attempts to address illegal 
  objects.  This was motivated by an illegal object access in the game 
  "Enemies" by Andy Phillips.
  (Reported by Thomas Troeger and David Picton)



Summary of changes between Unix Frotz 2.32R2 and Unix Frotz 2.40:
=================================================================

Unix Frotz 2.40 was released on Saturday November 11, 2000.

BUG FIXES

- Tab-completion now works in the middle of a sentence.

- Assorted fixes to make gcc stop complaining when using -Wall and -ansi
  flags.  These fixes included adding curly braces to avoid
  ambiguous-looking if-then-elses, adding parens to avoid abiguous-looking
  ands and ors, initializing variables even though there was no need to.

- Several functions in ux_text.c used functions that wanted
  *char.  Instead they were being passed *zchar.  Irix's cc
  complained.  Casts were added to fix this.

- The terminal erase character, as set with stty, now functions as
  backspace.  On many terminals, this character is DEL.

- Background colors should now work properly.

- timeout() from curses is now used for times input instead of a busy
  loop.

- ^L and ^R now redraw the screen instead of being passed as input to the
  Z-machine.

- ISO-Latin-1 characters are now valid input unless in plain ASCII mode.
  This makes the meta bit unusable for hotkeys.  On terminals with 8-bit
  character sets, alt usually sends ESC anyway.

- With zstrict error-checking tuning, the -i (for ignore errors) is
  superfluous and therefore has been removed.

- A supplementary memmove() function has been added for machines that lack
  it.  As I don't have access to a machine like this, the code is 
  untested.


NEW FEATURES

- Merged changed from Frotz 2.40 for DOS.

- Beginning with 2.40, the reference version of Frotz (the DOS version) is
 distributed under the GNU Public License rather than the old "no
 commercial profit" license.

- Unix Frotz 2.40, like the reference version, is now distributed under
  the GNU Public License.

- V6 games supported by drawing the outlines of pictures.  True display of
  the graphics are on hold until the X11 with GTK version is complete.

- Classical Infocom sound effects supported through the OSS drivers.  I'm
  only aware of "Lurking Horror" and "Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown
  Jewels" as having such sound effects.  See the INSTALL file for
  information on where the sound files should go.

- System-wide and per-user config files.

- Quetzal save format is now the default.  Old Zip 2.0 format is still
  supported by command line option or config file setting.

- $ZCODE_PATH and $INFOCOM_PATH environmental variables searched for game
  files.

- Faster undo functionality (borrowed from Nitfol).

- History searchs has been added.  Type the beginning of a past command
  and hit the up or down arrow key.
